# Loan-Repayment-Prediction

Harnessing data insights to make informed lending decisions.

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning to predict the likelihood of a client repaying a loan based on their information. It aids in making informed lending decisions, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the loan approval process.

## Technologies Utilized

Python (core language)    
Machine learning libraries (scikit-learn or others)    
Data manipulation libraries (pandas, NumPy)    
Data visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn)     
Deployment (streamlit)

## Note

The limited dataset from Kaggle contributes to model bias, favoring one decision due to insufficient diverse samples for training.
